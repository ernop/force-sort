# Force-Sort Graph Editor

This project is a minimal editor for an author relationship graph. The page `force.html` displays a D3 force‚Äëdirected diagram and lets you add or edit nodes and edges directly in the browser. Uploaded images are stored in the `images/` folder via `server.py` and referenced by the graph data file `data.json`.

## Running

Start the lightweight web server from the repository root:

```bash
python server.py
```

Then open [http://localhost:8007/force.html](http://localhost:8007/force.html) in your browser. The script allows image uploads, so using `python -m http.server` will only provide read‚Äëonly access.

## Product Goals

* **Simple editing.** Nodes and edges can be created, deleted and renamed without leaving the page.
* **Copy‚Äëto‚Äësave workflow.** All changes are reflected in the data view in the bottom‚Äëright corner. The text area turns yellow whenever the data differs from what you've copied. Click the area to copy the JSON to your clipboard and it turns white again. The page now also sends the data to `server.py` each time it changes so it is written to `data.json` automatically. Previous versions are stored in the `backups/` folder.
* **Image support.** Each node can hold multiple images. Paste or upload pictures while the editor popup is open, rearrange or remove them, and identical uploads are detected automatically. Image paths are stored in an `images` array on each node. The popup now reliably resets when switching between nodes so you never see another person's pictures by mistake.
* **Layout options.** A "tiers" layout is available in addition to the default force simulation. A new "force+direction" mode keeps edges mostly pointing downward while still using forces.
* **Filter persistence.** Active focus or year filters stay applied while you edit nodes or edges. The selected filters only change when you interact with the filter controls themselves.
* **Physics-based decluttering.** The force simulation uses adaptive link distances based on node degree, radial forces in focus mode, and proper momentum clearing when dragging nodes.
* **Smart label handling.** Long relationship labels are truncated with ellipsis and expand smoothly on hover with a subtle background for readability.

## Data Format

The `data.json` file contains two arrays: `nodes` and `links`. Each node holds an `id`, a `name`, an optional `birth_year`, and an `images` array. The `images` array may be empty or contain multiple file paths. Links store `id1`, `id2` and a `label` describing the connection.

The application aims to remain single‚Äëpage and self‚Äëcontained. Styling is kept minimal and everything is bundled inside `force.html` for easy hosting.

## Line Endings

All text files use **CRLF** (`\r\n`) line terminators. The repository includes `.gitattributes` and `.editorconfig` files so Git and common editors enforce this automatically. No additional setup is required.

# Interactive Graph Network Editor

A sophisticated web-based tool for creating, editing, and visualizing networks of relationships between people (authors, thinkers, etc.) across time. Built with D3.js force simulation for dynamic, interactive graph visualization.

## üéØ Core Philosophy & Design Principles

3. **Contextual Controls**: Year filtering, focus mode, search highlighting
4. **Responsive Feedback**: Hover effects, smooth transitions, immediate visual responses
5. **Minimal UI Friction**: Placeholders over labels, X buttons over Cancel, auto-close popups

## üé® Design System

### Colors (CSS Custom Properties)
```css
--primary-color: #2563eb      /* Blue for primary actions */
--success-color: #10b981      /* Green for focus mode */
--warning-color: #f59e0b      /* Amber for search highlights */
--danger-color: #ef4444       /* Red for delete actions */
--text-primary: #1e293b       /* Dark gray for main text */
--text-secondary: #64748b     /* Medium gray for labels */
```

### Interactive Elements
- **Hover effects** on all clickable elements
- **Drop shadows** for search highlights
- **Gradient buttons** with subtle animations
- **Smooth transitions** (0.2s ease) throughout
- **Black strokes** for nodes and edges
- **Truncated labels** with hover expansion

## üîß Key Implementation Details

### Graph Rendering
- Uses D3.js `forceSimulation()` with charge, center, link, and collision forces
- Nodes sized dynamically based on content length
- Arrow markers with proper positioning (`refX: 28`)
- Edge labels positioned at midpoint with collision detection
- Adaptive link distances based on node degree
- Radial force layout in focus mode

### State Management
- Global objects: `nodeById`, `linkById`, `focusedNodeId`
- Event-driven updates with `updateGraph()` and `updateVisualization()`
- Debounced localStorage saves for performance
- Proper momentum clearing on drag release

### Popup System
- **Single popup rule**: Close others when opening new
- **Click-away dismiss**: Event listeners on document
- **X button positioning**: Absolute positioned top-right
- **Form styling**: Consistent with main UI theme

### Year Filtering
- **NoUISlider** dual-handle range control
- **50-year intervals** for tick marks
- **Dynamic range** based on data min/max
- **Real-time filtering** with smooth transitions

### Physics Improvements
- **Adaptive link distance**: Nodes with more connections get more space
- **Radial forces**: Focus mode arranges connected nodes in clean patterns
- **Velocity decay**: 0.4 friction for natural movement
- **Alpha decay**: 0.005 for better settling time
- **Collision detection**: Variable radius based on node degree

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style Preferences
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features, const/let over var
- **Descriptive naming**: `openNodePopup()` not `openPopup()`
- **Event delegation**: Efficient DOM event handling
- **Modular functions**: Single responsibility principle
- **CSS organization**: Logical grouping, consistent naming
- **Targeted diffs**: Prefer small, specific changes over full rewrites

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Placeholders over labels**: Cleaner forms, less visual noise
- **Progressive disclosure**: Hide complexity until needed
- **Consistent interactions**: Same action patterns throughout
- **Visual hierarchy**: Size, color, and spacing for importance
- **Error prevention**: Validation and helpful defaults
- **Physics over hiding**: Use forces to declutter, don't remove data

### Performance Considerations
- **Debounced operations**: Search, save, filter updates
- **Efficient DOM updates**: Minimize redraws, batch changes
- **Event cleanup**: Remove listeners to prevent memory leaks
- **Selective rendering**: Only update changed elements
- **Smart label truncation**: Show full text only on hover
